            <p>
                Human-centered security and privacy emerge from how people live with and adapt technologies in specific cultural, social, and economic environments.
                In Asia, these environments are not only vast and varied but also fast-changing. 
                The region’s scale, diversity, and speed of digital adoption make it a crucial site for advancing human-centered perspectives on security and privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                What sets Asian contexts apart is not a single defining feature, but the intersection of many factors: the prominence of mobile-first access, multilingual and multicultural user bases, the widespread reliance on biometric and identity infrastructures, and the coexistence of high-tech urban centers with resource-constrained rural areas.
                These dynamics shape how threats are perceived, how protective measures are adopted, and what ``security'' and ``privacy'' mean in practice.
                Existing research in usable security and privacy often assumes models of individual ownership, consistent infrastructure, and relatively homogeneous user expectations, assumptions that do not always hold in Asia. 
                For example: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Threat models (and in general risk-benefit trade off for privacy/security related decision making) often overlook how cultural and social norms shape the negotiation of privacy in families, workplaces, and communities.</li>
                <li>Concepts of individual vs. communal privacy vary across cultures, complicating consent and data-sharing models.</li>
                <li>Authentication and identity management are heavily tied to biometrics and national ID systems.</li>
                <li>Security advice that assumes disposable income is infeasible with socio-economic constraints.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In response to these challenges, this workshop seeks to bring together researchers, designers and practitioners to explore human-centered security and privacy needs in Asian contexts as well as explore the suitability of existing systems to address those needs. 
                We aim to foster discussion and collaboration around the unique experiences, practices, and needs of the region's diverse user populations, while bridging insights from usable security, privacy, HCI and social sciences.

            <!-- <p>
                One-page position papers (excluding optional references) should detail relevant previous 
                research you have completed or novel perspectives on gender and sexuality at the 
                intersection of online safety, privacy, and security, or otherwise specify your interest for the workshop. 
                You will be asked if you are comfortable with sharing
                your position papers in advance of the workshop, so attendees can familiarize
                themselves with the other attendees. You will also be asked if you would be
                interested in presenting a lightning talk on the content of your position paper. 
                Position paper submissions should not be anonymous. Upon review by the 
                program committee members, up to five participants will be invited to give lightning talks during the workshop.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Two-page extended abstracts of work-in-progress research should detail ongoing work on gender 
                and sexuality at the intersection of online safety, privacy, and security. 
                The goal of these submissions is to enable researchers (including early career researchers or at later career stages)
                to get feedback on work-in-progress research from the GOSS community. We aim to create a diverse, inclusive,
                and confidential space for workshop attendees to solicit feedback and gather ideas. 
                Seven WIP submissions will be invited for presentation at during the workshop.
                Extended abstracts of WIPs may be anonymous, but be advised that presentations during the workshop will not be anonymous.
            </p>
            <p>
                The titles of the five lightning talks and seven WIPs will be made available on the
                workshop website, and the position papers and extended abstracts agreed for sharing
                will be accessible on a shared repository. All participants must register for the workshop
                and at least one author of a submission must attend the workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submissions do not need to follow any submission templates. You will also be asked
                to indicate whether you are comfortable with us sharing your submission in advance of
                the workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submissions should be submitted as a PDF via the SPAIC 2025 HotCRP: <a href="https://spaic2026.hotcrp.com" target="_blank">https://spaic2026.hotcrp.com</a>
